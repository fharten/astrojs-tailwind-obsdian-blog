## üßπ Post-Install Tips for Privacy

- Open a terminal and update everything:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -Syu
  ```
- Install a firewall (like `ufw`):
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S ufw
  sudo systemctl enable ufw
  sudo systemctl start ufw
  sudo ufw enable
  ```
- Avoid proprietary software that phones home. Stick to open-source repos and AUR packages you trust.
- Use privacy-friendly browsers like Firefox (with privacy tweaks) or Brave.
