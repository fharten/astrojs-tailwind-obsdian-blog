# 🚀 Why EndeavourOS? Installing an Arch-Based Linux Distro for Privacy Geeks

**Thinking about ditching Windows or macOS for something more private and customizable? Arch Linux-based EndeavourOS is a killer choice — lightweight, flexible, and privacy-respecting out of the box. Here’s why, plus a step-by-step install guide.**

## 🕵️‍♂️ Why Go Arch Linux (EndeavourOS) Over Windows or macOS?

- **Total Control:** Arch and its derivatives don’t phone home or track you. Windows and macOS? Not so much.
- **Minimal Bloat:** You install only what you want, which means fewer attack surfaces and less background data leakage.
- **Open Source:** No secret backdoors or shady telemetry hiding in compiled binaries.
- **Rolling Releases:** Keep your system fresh with the latest software and security fixes without waiting for big OS updates.
- **Privacy First:** You decide what’s installed and running — no forced cloud services or sneaky data grabs.

### 2. Create a Bootable USB Stick

Use a tool like **balenaEtcher** or **Rufus** (Windows) or `dd` (Linux/macOS):

- Insert a USB stick (4GB+).
- Flash the EndeavourOS ISO to the USB drive.

---

### 3. Boot from the USB

- Restart your PC and enter BIOS/UEFI (usually pressing `F12`, `DEL`, or `ESC` at startup).
- Select the USB stick as the boot device.
- You’ll see the EndeavourOS live environment boot menu.

---

### 4. Start the Installer

Click **“Start EndeavourOS Installer”** from the live desktop.

---

### 5. Choose Language, Keyboard, and Timezone

Pretty straightforward — pick what suits you.

---

### 6. Partition Your Disk

You have two main choices:

- **Erase entire disk** (easy if you want to fully switch)
- **Manual partitioning** (if you want dual boot or custom setup)

If unsure, choose erase entire disk for a clean slate.

---

### 7. Set User & Hostname

- Create your user account.
- Set a strong password.
- Set your computer’s hostname (your machine’s name on the network).

---

### 8. Review and Confirm

Double-check your choices. Click **“Install”** and wait a few minutes.

---

### 9. Reboot and Remove USB

After installation finishes, reboot your PC and remove the USB stick.

---

### 10. Welcome to EndeavourOS!

Log in with your new user account. You’re now running a sleek, privacy-friendly Arch-based Linux!

## 🧹 Post-Install Tips for Privacy

- Open a terminal and update everything:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -Syu
  ```
- Install a firewall (like `ufw`):
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S ufw
  sudo systemctl enable ufw
  sudo systemctl start ufw
  sudo ufw enable
  ```
- Avoid proprietary software that phones home. Stick to open-source repos and AUR packages you trust.
- Use privacy-friendly browsers like Firefox (with privacy tweaks) or Brave.
