# 🧰 Bye Google Drive: How to Install Unraid and Self-Host Like a Boss

**Sick of giving your files to Big Tech? Want total control over your storage, backups, and even media streaming? Unraid turns any old PC into your own private cloud — here’s how.**

---

## ☁️ Why Self-Host Instead of Using Google Drive or Dropbox?

Let’s be real — cloud services are convenient, but they come with trade-offs:

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Privacy? Nope.** Your data lives on someone else's server, and they can scan or snoop.
- 💸 **Monthly fees** that add up fast if you need more than a few gigs.
- 🔐 **Limited control** over security, access, or how data is stored.

### Enter: Unraid

Unraid is a Linux-based OS for **self-hosting** NAS (Network Attached Storage), containers, media servers, virtual machines — all from one box.

It’s:

- Super customizable
- Beginner-friendly (great web UI)
- Powerful AF once you grow into it

---

## 🛠️ What You’ll Need

- A PC or server (even old hardware works)
- At least one storage drive (more = better)
- A USB stick (1GB or more)
- A separate device to access the web interface (laptop/PC)
- Network connection (Ethernet recommended)

---

## 1. 🔽 Download Unraid USB Creator Tool

Go to the official site:  
👉 [https://unraid.net/download](https://unraid.net/download)

Download and install the **Unraid USB Creator** for your operating system.

## 2. 💾 Create a Bootable USB Drive

1. Launch the USB Creator tool.
2. Choose the latest Unraid version.
3. Pick your USB device from the list.
4. Give your server a name (hostname).
5. Click **Write** to flash Unraid onto your USB stick.

---

## 3. 🧼 Set Your BIOS to Boot from USB

Plug the USB into your server, boot it up, and immediately enter BIOS (usually `DEL`, `F2`, or `F12`).  
Set the **USB drive as the primary boot device**.

## 4. 🚀 Boot into Unraid and Access the Web UI

Unraid runs headless (no monitor required after setup). Once booted:

- Go to a browser on another device
- Visit: `http://tower.local`  
   (or check your router for its IP address)

You’ll land on the Unraid dashboard.

---

## 5. 🔑 Set Up Your Array and Storage

Once logged in:

1. Assign drives to the **Array** (main storage pool).
2. Assign a **Parity Drive** (optional but recommended for redundancy).
3. Start the array and format the drives.
4. Boom — your NAS is live.

---

## 6. ⚙️ Configure Shares and Access

Go to the **Shares** tab to create folders like:

- `/Media`
- `/Backups`
- `/Documents`

You can enable:

- **SMB (Windows file sharing)**
- **NFS**
- **FTP**
- **Time Machine** backups for macOS

---

## 7. 📦 Install Community Apps (Docker Heaven)

Click on the **Apps** tab (install the Community Applications plugin if it’s missing).  
This is where the fun begins:

- **Nextcloud** – your Google Drive alternative
- **Plex or Jellyfin** – stream your movies & shows
- **qBittorrent or Deluge** – private torrent client
- **WireGuard** – VPN into your home server
- **Vaultwarden** – self-hosted password manager

## 🔐 Bonus Privacy Tips

- Use a **VPN** to access Unraid remotely instead of exposing ports to the open internet.
- Keep Unraid updated for the latest security patches.
- Use strong passwords + SSL for the web UI.
- Back up your USB config to restore in case of corruption.

## 🎉 You Now Own Your Data

Congrats — you’ve officially taken your first step into **self-hosted freedom**.  
Unraid makes it easy to run your own private cloud, stream your media, automate backups, and stop giving your digital life to Big Tech.

**Next up?** Maybe self-hosting Nextcloud for Dropbox-style syncing, or setting up Vaultwarden to ditch cloud-based password managers. Stay tuned.
