# 🚀 How to Install GrapheneOS on Your Phone Without Bricking It

**Tired of Google breathing down your neck? Here’s how to install GrapheneOS and take back your privacy—without nuking your device.**

---

## 🧠 Before We Begin: What the Heck is GrapheneOS?

GrapheneOS is a super-secure, de-Googled Android-based operating system designed for privacy nerds like us. It only runs on **Pixel devices** (sorry Samsung fans), but in return, you get hardened security and control over your phone like never before.

👉 [More about GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org)

## ✅ What You’ll Need

- A **Google Pixel 6 or newer**
- A USB-C cable
- A laptop with **Chrome** or **Chromium**
- A stable internet connection
- About 30–60 minutes of free time
- Basic common sense 😎

> ⚠️ This process **wipes your phone**. Back it up if you care about your data.

## 1. 🔒 Unlock Your Bootloader

First step is unlocking your Pixel's bootloader. This makes the phone moddable, but also **less secure** until GrapheneOS is installed. Fair trade.

1. On your Pixel:
   - Go to **Settings > About phone**
   - Tap **Build number** 7 times to unlock Developer Options.

2. Now go to:
   - **Settings > System > Developer options**
   - Enable **OEM unlocking** and **USB debugging**

3. Plug your phone into your computer.
4. Reboot into bootloader mode:
   - Hold **Power + Volume Down**

5. On your computer, open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   fastboot flashing unlock
   ```

6. Confirm on the phone using volume/power buttons.

## 2. 💻 Use the Official Web Installer

GrapheneOS has a really slick [**WebUSB-based installer**](https://grapheneos.org/install/web) that works right in your browser. Yes, really.

1. Open the installer in **Chrome or Chromium**:  
   👉 [grapheneos.org/install/web](https://grapheneos.org/install/web)
2. Click **"Connect"**, and follow the steps:
   - Flash the factory image
   - Lock the bootloader after install (important!)
   - Reboot and enjoy

## 3. 🔄 Lock the Bootloader Again

Once installed, **lock the bootloader** to keep the security benefits of GrapheneOS:

1. Reboot into the bootloader again:
   - Hold **Power + Volume Down**

2. Run:

   ```bash
   fastboot flashing lock
   ```

3. Confirm on the device.

Congrats, your phone is now an **encrypted fortress**. No more Google snooping unless you let them in.
