# 🕵️‍♂️ Go Ghost: How to Create an Anonymous Email Chain with Tor, Tuta, and Proton

**Learn how to set up a fully anonymous email setup using Tor Browser, Tuta.com, and ProtonMail — no phone numbers, no personal info, no digital breadcrumbs.**

---

## 🔧 What You’ll Need

- A laptop or desktop (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
    
- Internet access (preferably not tied to your real name)
    
- 15–30 minutes of your time
    
- A bit of patience (Tor isn’t exactly lightning fast)

## 1. 🧅 Install and Run Tor Browser

Tor is your privacy portal — it routes your traffic through a chain of encrypted nodes so nobody can tell where you're coming from.

1. Go to the [Tor Project download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/).
    
2. Download the version for your operating system.
    
3. Install it like a normal browser.
    
4. Open Tor and click **“Connect”**.

## 2. 📧 Create a Tuta.com Email (Without Doxxing Yourself)

Tuta (formerly Tutanota) is an encrypted, privacy-first email service — and crucially, **doesn't ask for a phone number**.

1. While using Tor, go to [tuta.com/signup](https://tuta.com/signup).
    
2. Choose the **free plan**.
    
3. Pick a totally anonymous username — avoid anything tied to your real identity.
    
4. Set a strong password (use a local password manager like KeePassXC).
    
5. Skip recovery options — they’re a privacy leak.

## 3. 🪪 Use Tuta to Create a ProtonMail Account

Now let’s use your Tuta email to create a ProtonMail account — Proton is more mainstream, but still fully encrypted and private.

1. Still inside Tor, go to [proton.me](https://proton.me).
    
2. Click **“Sign Up”** and choose the free ProtonMail plan.
    
3. Use your new Tuta email as the recovery/verification email.
    
4. Confirm the email via your Tuta inbox.
    
5. Choose a Proton username that’s also anonymous.

## 💡 Pro Tips for Staying Private

- Don’t use these accounts outside Tor.
    
- Always use strong, unique passwords.
    
- Never link them to your real identity (email, phone, socials).
    
- Don’t forward personal emails to them — that defeats the whole point.
